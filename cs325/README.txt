runs on python version 3.11.2

i put both projects under the same file so it gives both output.txt and comments.txt

i couldn't make a yaml file because i kept getting errors, but make sure that 'requests' is installed by typeing in the terminal: pip install requests.

run the file in a terminal by typeing: python cs325.py <URL>
where <URL>  is a reddit thread like 'https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/16brnzb/self_aware/'. it maybe better to replace the 'www' with 'old'
